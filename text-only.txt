Dear Mr B,

Hi.

I'm writing you this letter because I just got back to Sydney from Queensland. I only just got in touch with you to try to meet up this afternoon, and I never replied to your polite decline. I'm sure you really were at school until 6pm. I went past you around four and thought about texting then but didn't end up pressing send. The clock says 11.10pm for me now and it'd be rude to text past your midnight. I heard you had a baby now.

I walked to Stephens Road at 3.30pm to see my old house. I'd looked you up and I knew you were near by.

I walked from the train station by the galleries I used to wander around alone, to the ghost of the cafe I used to work at, past the church where a balding man with a maths doctorate used to make chai for swaying and wrinkled women, the hardware store where I bought a glass cutter for some brilliant idea I never executed, the street I'd seen SPB (a beautiful pizza chef at my ghost cafe), the park where I walked with TLB through mist to the stairs and read bukowski, a fridge like the one we'd photographed the mannequin arm inside, Cyrillic letters on a white washed chapel where I'd seen a wedding party, walking past girls in bright green dresses and boys in yellow, to the short brick wall where I smoked with BRS while he complained pointedly about being lonely across the road from where I'd lived.

The yellow paint on my old house was still peeling, the windows still barred, the tame flowers still growing wildly, all doors open to let air circulate. I tried not to stare as a woman walked down the corridor to take out the rubbish. I thought about the time I spent there, lying in bed terrified of moths, listening to TLB's paranoia, eating nothing but poppadoms, sleeping all the time, trying to stay dreaming, trying to write F R E E D O M on the walls with cut out book pages. (I got to F R.)

So I lay on the wall opposite, casually looking out for you and practising how surprised I'd pretend to be if you did go past, studying the leaves between me and the sky. The veins split oddly in five, a circle from the centre.

I don't know if I'd have recognised you if you walked past.

I walked closer to (probably) you, past the tracks I'd wanted to jump on to, past the roads I remembered, past more boys in uniform.

"It'll be over soon," a mother warned one she was walking with, "and you'll miss being with them all the time."

A sign told me: "Celebrate the past. Live in the present." I don't know what it told me to do about the future. Become it? Embrace it?

As I walked back down past the tracks I'd fantasised of dying on, past the house where I excused my cowardice by smoking and starving my way towards death, I was furious about the sign. Celebrate the past? Should I celebrate the weight I lost then without criticising the context of what allowed it? Or - probably more relevantly - should we uncritically celebrate the white history of colonial nations without criticising the context of the displacement, rape and murder that allowed it?

It was a

It's hard for me to imagine a future for myself. I had expected Australia to run out of water, ravaged by fires and cyclones, chaos and the bad kind of anarchy in the streets.

Shortly after we moved to Queensland in 2001, it stopped raining. The longer I spent there, the lower the dam levels were, the more headlines were dominated by suicidal farmers and starving cattle and cracked landscape, the less time we had to shower, the browner the grass was. I didn't think it would reverse.

I spent time this weekend with MML, MKW, KB, TCH - all former Emmanuel students who left almost ten years ago. You taught three of us. We all talked about our impressions now of our time at school and how people had grown up.

I'm 25 now, turning 26 in a month. I remember you were born in 1979 because that Smashing Pumpkins song had particular significance to you. You would have been 27 when I finished high school, maybe 23 when you first started teaching me.

I remember our first classes where you tried to explain capitalism with top hats on the whiteboard. I liked you because you were strange and uncertain and you listened wide-eyed and spoke animatedly. It felt like you were all there to be accessed, sincere and vulnerable, and you wanted to make this shitty and incomprehensible world a little better and more understandable for some people.

In a lot of ways you were the only positive thing about my experience at Emmanuel, although you had your problematic moments too. I distinctly remember in one of those English detentions you used to hand out I detailed to you the problems I had with motivation and concentration to start and complete homework, symptoms of what has now been diagnosed as ADHD and could have been effectively treated if it'd been recognised as such back then, and your reply was: 'have you ever considered that you're just lazy?'

I've always regarded my years at Emmanuel negatively. There was a combination of the general pain of adolescence, the difficulty of being different - fat, nerdy, queer - in Emmanuel's and the Gold Coast's aggressively homogenous culture, mental health issues that may have popped up regardless of where I'd been, general issues about Christian schools, and specific issues about Emmanuel.

Adolescence

Fat

Nerdy

I don't think I ever spoke to you about sexuality in anything more than a theoretical context.

Gold Coast

Mental health

Christian schools

Emmanuel is the worst
