## Letter to Mr B

Dear Mr B,

- I don't know how you can be complicit in this damaging system as a deeply principled and intelligent person for whom I have great respect. 

- on some level this is an ethical objection to the very principle of religious schools, coloured by the general pain of adolescence and a deep disdain for the homogenous culture of the Gold Coast

- religious programs being compulsory

- views of mental health, community leadership, and success having religious prerequisites

- explicitly discriminatory hiring program is deeply fucked and I'm shocked that it is legal

- it's clearly not the worst, looking at the Royal Commission - but I don't doubt that Emmanuel would deal just as poorly with abuse

Things I remember

From Merrin
